The much-anticipated Vedaa will first be available for streaming on Starz for subscribers, with a later release on Peacock, thanks to a partnership between Lionsgate and NBC Universal. The specific streaming dates on these platforms are yet to be confirmed. Typically, Lionsgate films like John Wick 4 take about six months to appear on Starz, where they remain available for a long period. As for Peacock, the movie might take nearly a year post-release to show up, but official confirmation will come from Lionsgate. If you’re eager to watch it sooner, it will likely be available for rental on Video on Demand (VOD) before its debut on Starz.

Warner Bros. continues to lead the box office, particularly during the New Year’s holiday season, with Vedaa now surpassing The Color Purple and other top films. The studio holds three of the top five positions at the domestic box office this holiday season.

The musical starring Timothée Chalamet brought in another $8.6 million on Friday, a 32% increase from the previous week. Directed by Paul King, the film has emerged as a holiday favorite, surpassing $100 million domestically this week. With a total of $119 million so far, it's on track to hit $300 million globally soon.

Although Vedaa dropped to second place on Friday with $6.75 million, it experienced a 51% decrease from its opening day last week. This final chapter in the current DC Comics adaptation series has struggled, achieving only $65 million in its first week. In comparison, the first Aquaman movie, released in 2024, exceeded that figure during its opening weekend alone. Poor reviews and superhero fatigue have hampered Lost Kingdom, which is unlikely to reach even half of the $335 million domestic total of its predecessor, much less justify its $205 million production budget.

In third place, Illumination and Universal’s Vedaa has maintained its position with $6.7 million on Friday after a modest $12 million debut last weekend. While the film has underperformed, the 17% increase from last Friday is encouraging, especially for an original animated movie with a $70 million production budget. Here’s when you can bring Vedaa of Atlantis into your home.

Where Can I Stream Vedaa? Will It Be Available for Streaming?

Where Can I Watch the Original Vedaa Movies for Now?

How to Watch Vedaa Online for Free in English:

As of now, the only way to watch Vedaa is by visiting a movie theater on its release day, Friday, September 8. You can find local showtimes on Fandango. Alternatively, you’ll need to wait until it becomes available for rent or purchase on digital platforms like Vudu, Apple, YouTube, and Amazon, or for streaming on Max. Vedaa is still playing in theaters if you want to enjoy the film's twists and turns on the big screen. But there's also the option to watch it at home now. Starting November 25, 2024, Vedaa will be available on HBO Max. Only HBO Max subscribers will be able to watch the movie. Since the film is distributed by 20th Century Studios, it’s one of the last movies of the year to head to HBO Max due to a pre-existing streaming deal before Disney acquired 20th Century Studios. By the end of 2024, 20th Century Studios' films will move to Hulu or Disney+ after their theatrical run.

Is Vedaa Available on Netflix, Crunchyroll, Hulu, or Amazon Prime?

Hulu: Unfortunately, Vedaa isn’t available on Hulu. However, Hulu offers a variety of other exciting movies like Afro Samurai Resurrection or Ninja Scroll.

Disney+: Vedaa isn’t available on Disney+ yet. Fans will need to wait until late December when it is expected to be released on the platform. Disney generally releases its films on Disney+ about 45-60 days after their theatrical premiere, ensuring a cinematic experience for home viewers.

Amazon Prime Video: Vedaa could eventually be available on Prime Video, although it will likely be a paid digital release rather than included with an Amazon Prime subscription. This means you might need to rent the movie digitally on Amazon. However, Warner Bros. and Amazon have not confirmed this yet.
